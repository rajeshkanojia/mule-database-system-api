Project name : Mulesoft Mysql Database System API
Developer name : Rajesh Kumar Kanojia

My first project as build a system api. I take user table with following schema and try to implement GET, POST, DELETE and PUT operation on the same table.


Users table schema:- 
	CREATE TABLE users(
	    id  INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
	    first_name  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	    last_name  VARCHAR(100),
	    email  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	    date_of_birth  DATE,
	    date_of_joining  DATE,
	    password  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	    account_status  ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'block', 'suspended'),
	    email_verification_status  ENUM('verified', 'unverified'),
	    hashID VARCHAR(255),
	    hashKey VARCHAR(255),
	    PRIMARY KEY ( id ),
	    UNIQUE (email),
	);

Here is don't want to share/display my primary key(id) to end user so i created a new field with name hashID. As email field is unique index in my table so i simply hash this field with SHA1 and store the binary data in hashID field. This field will wark as primary key for user.

For the GET operation 2 type of response format is available 
	1 - JSON
	2 - XML

	to achive this functinality i user Dynamic Evaluation component. To get xml format output we need to pass format=xml in url, json is the default format.

GET users:-
	There are two ways to fetch/filter user record,
	1- user by ID 	

	2- all user or filter user based on first_name, last_name, email, hashID, account_status, email_verification_status


Post users:-

Delete user:-

Put user:-
